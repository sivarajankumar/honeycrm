## zoho crm ##
  * http://www.zoho.com/
  * demo at http://crm.zoho.com/crm/ShowHomePage.do
  * **impressive**, looks nice, feels relatively fast - still, should be faster
  * nice reporting with very fast export functionality
  * layout looks similar to salesforce and sugarcrm. actually the vendor compares the prices with sugarcrm, salesforce.com and act.
  * at the bottom of the page stays a panel displaying notifications and allowing to chat with other employees i.e. zoho integrates an instant messaging tool for collaboration, too.
