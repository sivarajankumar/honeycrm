  * one option might be the integration of an already existing theme
    * e.g. the Waffles theme from drupal, see http://drupal.org/project/waffles

## thoughts ##
  * very yellow, like drowning in honey
  * we will probably need ~ 50% more width for the detail view -> need flexibility for changing between wide list views and wide detail views
    * workspaces
    * split layout panels
  * low number of tabs might be a good thing since too much tabs are confusing. still we may need additional space for more tabs.
  * the global search bar has disappeared. do we distinguish between global and module scoped search? from a user perspective it might be better (simpler) to display only one search field. however, this way he also uses the control about the search scope which might be a bad idea when the database contains a lot of data.
  * a lot of space is somewhat wasted at the top. since we still want to display things like recently used items or mini-reports we may have to remove this.
